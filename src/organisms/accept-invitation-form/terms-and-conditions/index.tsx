              <strong>Alternative payment accounts: </strong>Infollion Research
              will strive to provide the preferred way of crediting your
              engagement fee to you or direct payment to your employer accounts.

              your employer, you agree, so long as your relationship with your
              employer exists or your employer provides otherwise in writing,
              that payments will be made to your employer. However, the decision
              to use any of these payment methods will lie solely with Infollion

              agreement, and to the extent that you have already received such
              payments for engagements, Infollion Research will have the right
